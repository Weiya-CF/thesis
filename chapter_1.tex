\section{Introduction}
This chapter presents a general state of the art of different topics related to using immersive virtual environment for collaborative work. Being the joint interest of Virtual Reality (VR) and Computer Supported Collaborative Work (CSCW), the research on Shared Virtual Environment (SVE) or Collaborative Virtual Environment becomes more and more popular.

With the rapid increasing computation capacity and the development of computer network, multi-agent collaboration via computer-generated virtual space with new types of communication and interaction becomes available.

\section{Virtual Reality}

\subsection{Virtual Environment}
According to \citet{Fox2009Guide}, a virtual environment (VE) is a digital space in which a user's movements are tracked and his or her surroundings rendered, or digitally composed and displayed to the senses, in accordance with those movements.


\subsection{Immersion and Presence}
Studies have shown that immersion, which can invoke the feeling of presence \citep{Slater1994DepthPre}, has not only a pronounced effect on user performance \citep{Dangelo2008Benefits}, but also has an impact on the social relationship between collaborators \citep{Slater2000Small}.

\paragraph{Immersive Projection Display}
Projection-based VR displays, especially systems with Immersive Projected Technologies (IPT) like stereoscopic image walls or CAVEs \citep{CruzNeira1993SPV}, 


\paragraph{Head Mounted Display}
Head-Mounted Displays (HMDs) \citep{Melzer1997HMD}, as the name indicates, is a helmet containing two separated displays that are put directly in front of user's eyes allowing visual immersion. 

For example, in the Studierstube project \citep{Schmalstieg2002Stube}, users wear tracked see-through HMDs to perceive both the physical environment and synthetic images at the same time.

\subsection{Summary}

\section{Computer Supported Collaborative Work}
CVE (Collaborative Virtual Environment) refers to a virtual environment that can be shared by participants connected by a computer (remote or local) network. Users are connected with the virtual world through graphic embodiments called avatars.

A collaborative virtual environment (CVE) \citep{Benford2001CVE} enables multiple users to interact \citep{Schroeder2006Usability} and to achieve collaborative tasks \citep{Dodds2009Using} within the same virtual environment. Users can be co-located in the same place or connected remotely.

\subsection{Typology}

\subsection{User-related Factors}

\subsubsection{User Representation}
Avatars or virtual humans have long been used as virtual representation of the users, or we can call it user embodiment \citep{Benford1995UEC}. Avatars can provide various important functions in a multi-user virtual environment \citep{Thalmann2001VHR}. For example, a user can get other users' positions, focus of interest and see what they are doing, etc. Users can also get a representation of self in the virtual environment by using self-avatars \citep{Lok2003Effects}, which may be especially useful when working with HMDs. Moreover, according to the task that the users need to achieve in the virtual context, social representation of self may be provided through dedicated virtual clothings and/or virtual tools. In an immersive virtual environment, avatars can play a crucial role for user interaction and communication \citep{Slater1994Body}. Users work together not only in a shared virtual world, but also in a shared social space where social human communication is conveyed by avatars \citep{Roberts2004SSH}.

Several techniques can be used to bring avatars to life. In a desktop configuration, we can use input devices like keyboards to activate predefined animations. While in an immersive virtual environment, real time motion capture systems such as Kinect or optical tracking devices are more suitable to map user's physical motion to an avatar \citep{Mohler2010Effect, Vera2011AugMir, Normand2012FBA}. Due to technology limitations or high cost, humanoid avatars do not commonly support facial expression and other subtle social cues. Another interesting method developed by \citet{Ogi2001SteAva} introduces a fully animated video avatar based on live video capture. \citet{Beck2013IGG} used a similar technique to enable interactions between multiple co-located users and a group of remote users by their avatars.
