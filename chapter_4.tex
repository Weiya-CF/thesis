\section{Introduction}
When it comes to managing multiple users in the same immersive virtual environment for co-located collaboration, most works focused on closely coupled stage situations. In this case, either virtual navigation is disabled (they can just walk inside the tracking area for observation or co-manipulation), or their navigation is controlled by a leader and shared by other users~\citep{Beck2013GGT, Kulik2011CSS}. To enable more complex collaborative scenario including both loosely coupled and closely coupled tasks, it is interesting to allow safe individual navigation for co-located users.
